  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Motivated and dedicated Youth Worker Coordinator with 2 years of experience in empowering and supporting young individuals. Highly skilled in team management, event organization, and teaching techniques to volunteers and workers. Demonstrated ability to quickly adapt and learn new concepts. Notable achievement includes creating and leading a pioneering project during my European Solidarity Corps volunteer program in Finland, which resulted in the establishment of the first LGBTAQ+ youth space in the city of Kerava. Committed to continuous self-improvement, I have undertaken self-study initiatives to expand my knowledge.<br><br>
